# Description

## Scripts invoked via `npm` and `yarn run`

### `buildFlow.js`

For each `.js` file under `src`, creates a corresponding `.js.flow` file under `dist`; these files are included in the published NPM packages, so that codebases can consume the Flow types. This script is invoked via `yarn run build-flow` (and also `yarn run build`).

### `buildJs.js`

Compiles `.js` files under `src` using Babel, writing the output to `dist`. This script is invoked via `yarn run build-js` (and also `yarn run build`).

### `pretty.js`

Prettifies the code base, or tests that it is already prettified. This script is invoked for these two purposes respectively via `yarn run pretty` and `yarn run pretty-check` (and also `npm test`).

## Typescript Configs

`.build.*` - used for project references
`.base.*` - used for extends for downstream tsconfigs
