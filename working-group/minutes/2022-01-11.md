## Agenda
1. How to make contributions accessible
2. Decision making processes
3. Roadmap

## Notes
- Contributions
- Split CONTRIBUTING doc up
- Layers of specialization
- There are only certain layers you need to care about

## Actionable Steps
- Tim: Will make sure to get a design ready asap
- Once we have consent for that design, we can start implementing it and move forward with a minimal v2 alpha
- For that implementation, pairing is a great opportunity, as Rikki has a lot of context to share
- We'll look into theming systems, like `theme-ui`
- Rikki: Will mark what is required for GraphiQL@2 with labels
- Rikki: Start writing plan (which so far was mostly verbal)
