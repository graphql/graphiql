## 1st GraphiQL Working Group Minutes

- GraphiQL 1.0 re-architecture: will ship with a plugin system, and a leaner query tool as it's base
- Design / Architecture discussions and concrete decisions will continue to occur in github issues for GraphiQL, and ad-hoc WG meetings as necessary
- Decided on new contributing guidelines:
  - Every PR should have at least one peer review before merge (enforced via github config)
  - This review should not come from a member of the same company
  - Rebase and merge should be used, squash if necessary. Multiple individual commits for review changes, requested changes, or to split up a major PR make sense.
  - Clean git history is preferred
  - As much automation as possible will be provided to minimize the review effort
  - Hyo reminded us that performance and large-scale concerns are important. Performance impact should always be a consideration.
- Contributing.md will be updated to reflect these guidelines
- We would like to propose to the GraphQL Foundation itself that the group be renamed and/or our scope be redefined to be for all GraphQL ide tooling. Thus the "GraphQL IDE Tooling WG" or "GraphQL Tooling WG". We would like to be responsible for `codemirror-graphql` and `graphql-language-services`.
- We will prepare a prioritized list of technical debt items for contributors to work on.
  - A GH label for this perhaps?
