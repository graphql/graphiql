## Agenda

> This month it's all about the GraphiQL Monaco/Redesign/Plugins effort!

- Introductions
- Brief discussion of Playground transition as it relates to new features and plugin API
- Review Plugins Meta Issue: https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/pull/983
- Demonstrate Monaco Mode RFC PR: https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/pull/1459
- Demonstrate/Discuss GraphiQL Context Rewrite RFC PR: https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/pull/1468
  - IMPORTANT NOTE: this PR will be the base for other PRs for redesign, and is the first draft of the underlying APIs that plugins would consume via context/hooks! Please give feedback and start opening your own PRs!
- Decide how we will begin to organize & address Plugin API Proposals, RFCs.
  - Should actual Plugin Proposals and RFCs be handled differently from Plugin API Proposals and RFCs?
  - See [this planning project](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/projects/10), though many feature requests have not been added to this yet.
  - all issues/PRs labelled 'potential plugin' (and more) should be reviewed, as well as graphql playground features to adopt
