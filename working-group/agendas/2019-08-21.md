The 3rd GraphiQL Working Group meeting will involve updates on current progress with graphiql 0.13.x, codemirror-graphql-2 and graphql-language-service-\* 2.0.x releases. We've also introduced a new approach for extending the LSP, starting with schema loading.
Further discussion of the next major version of GraphiQL and progress with the IDE ecosystem in terms of an official vscode-graphql-language-service, graphql-monaco, and an official vscode-extension.
