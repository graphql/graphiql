## Ad-Hoc `monaco-graphql` WG pairing session re: SDL editing

### In Attendance

- [@cshaver](github.com/cshaver)
- [@acao](github.com/acao)

### Agenda

- Review bugs with an SDL editing implementation of `monaco-graphql`
- Determine what RFCs we can present to make this problem easier to solve

### Minutes

we looked at:

- confirmed on the latest vite example, too many workers is triggered by schema changes
- look at how schema is shared with the worker, since this can change often
  - e.g. innoDB, cache api

found some bugs:

- (monaco-editor) bg missing on autocomplete box - need to create a bug ticket for them!
- repro'd https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/pull/2171/files
- monaco-react webpack example has some bugs that vite doesn't
  - would be cool to get a basic cypress test (get model markers from monaco), visual diff testing
- (monaco?) lots of logs from monarchCommon on parsing directives
- improve webpack example config, so the web workers output name aren't hashed
- devx of running examples from root maybe: `pnpm run example:<example name>`
