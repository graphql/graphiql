Example GraphiQL Install
========================

This example uses the version of GraphiQL found in the parent directory, rather
than depending on npm, so that it is easier to test new changes. In order to use this
example as a basis for development, you must have at least Node 6 installed.

Instructions:
1. Run `npm install` in the parent directory
2. Navigate to this directory (example)
3. `npm install`
4. Navigate back to the root of the project
5. `npm run dev`
6. Open your browser to [http://localhost:8080/]()

Once this is done, changes will recompile, and you can reload GraphiQL to see them live!
