### Getting Started

1. First, you will need to have the latest git, yarn 1.16 & node 12 or greater installed. OSX, Windows and Linux should all be supported as build environments.

**None of these commands will work with `npm`. Please use `yarn` to develop with graphql**.

1. Fork this repo by using the "Fork" button in the upper-right

2. Check out your fork

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:yournamehere/graphiql.git
   ```

3. Install or Update all dependencies

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

4. Build all interdependencies so the project you are working on can resolve other packages

   ```sh
   yarn run build
   ```

   you can also use

   ```sh
   yarn run watch
   ```

   if you are focused on GraphiQL development, you can run

   ```sh
   yarn run start-graphiql
   ```

5. Get coding! If you've added code, add tests. If you've changed APIs, update
   any relevant documentation or tests. Ensure your work is committed within a
   feature branch.

6. Ensure all tests pass, and build everything

   ```sh
   yarn test
   ```

### Developing for GraphiQL

If you want to develop just for graphiql, you don't even need to execute commands from the package subdirectory at `packages/graphiql`.

First, you'll need to `yarn build` all the packages from the root.

Then, you can run these commands:

- `yarn start-graphiql` will launch webpack dev server for graphiql from the root
- `yarn start-monaco` will launch webpack dev server for the monaco editor example with github API from the root. this is the fastest way to test changes to `graphql-language-service-interface`, parser, etc.

if you want these commands to watch for changes to dependent packages in the repo, then `yarn build --watch` is what you want to run alongside either of these.

**Run tests for GraphiQL:**

- `yarn test graphiql` will run all tests for graphiql. you can also run tests from a workspace, but most tooling is at the root.
- `yarn test --watch` will run jest with --watch
- `yarn e2e` at the root will run the end to end suite. you can just run `ci e2e` if everything is already built

**fix CI issues with linting**

if you have prettier or eslint --fix able issues you see in CI, use yarn format:

`yarn format`

if you see typescript build issues, do a `yarn build` locally and make sure the whole project references tree builds. changing interfaces can end up breaking their implementations.

### All Commands

1. `yarn` - install and link all packages
2. `yarn build` - cleans first, then builds everything but webpack bundles - `tsc --build`, `babel` etc
3. `yarn build-ts` - builds typescript using `--build` and `--force` flag.
4. `yarn watch` - runs `tsc --build --watch`, for when you make cross-repository changes
5. `yarn build-bundles` - builds webpack bundles that are used for releases
6. `yarn build-demo` - builds demo projects for netlify; we run this on CI to make sure webpack can consume our project in a standalone project.
7. `yarn test` - runs `jest`. so `yarn t --watch`
8. `yarn format` - autoformats with eslint --fix and prettier
9. `yarn lint` - checks for linting issues
10. `yarn e2e` - runs cypress headlessly against the minified bundle and a local schema server, like in CI.
11. `yarn jest` - runs global jest commands across the entire monorepo; try `yarn test --watch` or `yarn jtest DocExplorer` for example :D
