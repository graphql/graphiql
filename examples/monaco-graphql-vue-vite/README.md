## Description

This is an extremely naive & minimalistic implementation of `monaco-graphql` with `react` using `vite` as a bundler.

This workspace could be used to help us prototype components & hooks for `@graphiql/react`

## Setup

First, `yarn` in the root, and then `yarn build` in the root

Then, in this directory, you can just run `yarn start`
