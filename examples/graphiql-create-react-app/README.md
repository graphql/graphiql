## GraphiQL `create-react-app` Example

This example demonstrates how to transpile your own custom ES6 and typescript GraphiQL implementation bootstrapped with `create-react-app`, no config needed.

### Setup

1. Run `yarn` at root of the repository to install the dependencies.
1. Run `yarn build && yarn build-bundles` at the root to build graphiql for import
1. run both `yarn` and `yarn start` from this folder to install modules and start `react-scripts` dev server.
1. `yarn build` from this folder to build production ready transpiled files using `react-scripts`. Find the output in `build` folder.
