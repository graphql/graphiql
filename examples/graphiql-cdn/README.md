# GraphiQL CDN Example

This is a simple example of using **GraphiQL** directly from a CDN, including the [GraphiQL Explorer plugin](../../packages/graphiql-plugin-explorer/README.md).

It loads the latest GraphiQL version from [esm.sh](https://esm.sh), an ESM-based CDN that serves npm packages as ES modules.

## Setup

No installation or build step is required — just open the `index.html` file in your browser:

* macOS:

  ```sh
  open index.html
  ```
* Linux:

  ```sh
  firefox index.html
  # or
  chromium index.html
  ```
