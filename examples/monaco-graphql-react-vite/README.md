## Description

This is an extremely naive & minimalist implementation of `monaco-graphql` with
`react` using `vite` as a bundler.

This workspace could be used to help us prototype components & hooks for
`@graphiql/react`

[Here is a StackBlitz demo of this example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/monaco-graphql-react-vite?file=src/App.tsx)

## Setup

In this directory, you can just run `yarn` and `yarn dev`
