## Description

This is an extremely naive & minimalistic implementation of `monaco-graphql` with `react` using `vite` as a bundler.

This workspace could be used to help us prototype components & hooks for `@graphiql/react`

[Here is a StackBlitz demo of this example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/monaco-graphql-react-vite?file=src/App.tsx)

## Setup

First, `pnpm` in the root, and then `pnpm build` in the root

Then, in this directory, you can just run `pnpm start`
