Setting up the new `@graphiql/react` package with [`@walaura`](https://github.com/walaura)'s common components, theming system and storybook. These components were modernized by [`@ryan-m-walker`](https://github.com/ryan-m-walker) and [`@zephraph`](https://github.com/zephraph) and others in the 2.x rfc effort

These components will be the building blocks for other copoents in `@graphiql/react`, for the new `graphiql` 2.x, and for user plugins and extensions as documented in the [Latest architectural proposal](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/discussions/1787), similarly done in previous proposals
