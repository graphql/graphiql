Add CSS variables for color alpha values:
- `--alpha-secondary`: A color for supplementary text that should be read but not be the main focus
- `--alpha-tertiary`: A color for supplementary text which is optional to read, i.e. the UI would function without the user reading this text
- `--alpha-background-light`, `--alpha-background-medium` and `--alpha-background-heavy`: Three alpha values used for backgrounds and borders that have different intensity
