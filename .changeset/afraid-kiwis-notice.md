BREAKING:
- The `ExecutionContextProvider` and `QueryEditor` components no longer accept the `externalFragments` prop. Instead the prop can now be passed to the `EditorContextProvider` component. The provider component will normalize the prop value and provide a map of type `Map<string, FragmentDefinitionNode>` (using the fragment names as keys) as part of the value of the `EditorContext`.
- The `QueryEditor` component no longer accept the `validationRules` prop. Instead the prop can now be passed to the `EditorContextProvider` component. The provider component will provide the list of validation rules (empty if there are none) as part of the value of the `EditorContext`.
- The `ExecutionContextProvider` and `HeaderEditor` components no longer accept the `shouldPersistHeaders` prop. Instead the `EditorContextProvider` component now provides the value of its equally named prop as part of the value of the `EditorContext`.
