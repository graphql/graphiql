## Overview

GraphiQL is the reference implementation of this monorepo, GraphQL IDE, an official project under the GraphQL Foundation. The code uses the permissive MIT license.

Whether you want a simple GraphiQL IDE instance for your server, or a more advanced web or desktop GraphQL IDE experience for your framework or plugin, or you want to build an IDE extension or plugin, you've come to the right place!

The purpose of this monorepo is to give the GraphQL Community:

- a to-specification official language service (see: [API Docs](https://graphiql-test.netlify.app/typedoc))
- a comprehensive LSP server and CLI service for use with IDEs
- a codemirror mode
- a monaco mode (in the works)
- an example of how to use this ecosystem with GraphiQL.
- examples of how to implement or extend GraphiQL.

### Latest Stable Ecosystem

`graphiql@1.0.x` and ecosystem are organized as below. Any further changes to `graphiql@1.0.x` are made against `1.0.0` branch

### Proposed Ecosystem

As we re-write for `graphiql@2.x` ecosystem, this monorepo will contain an sdk and plugins.

Utilities to support the [GraphQL Language Service](packages/graphql-language-service#readme).

## Browser & Runtime Support

Many of these packages need to work in multiple environments.

By default, all typescript packages target `es6`.

`graphql-language-service-server` and `graphql-language-service-cli` are made for the node runtime, so they target `es2017`

`codemirror-graphql` and the `graphiql` browser bundle use the [`.browserslistrc`](./.browserlistrc), which targets modern browsers to keep bundle size small and keep the language services performant where async/await is used, and especially to avoid the requirement of `rengenerator-runtime` or special babel configuration.

### [`.browserslistrc`](./.browserlistrc):

```
last 2 versions
Firefox ESR
not dead
not IE 11
not ios 10
maintained node versions
```

To be clear, we do _not_ support Internet Explorer or older versions of evergreen browsers.

## Contributing

This is an open source project, and we welcome contributions. Please see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute.

### Fielding Proposals!

The door is open for proposals for the new GraphiQL Plugin API, and other ideas on how to make the rest of the IDE ecosystem more performant, scaleable, interoperable and extensible.
Feel free to open a PR to create a document in the `/proposals/` directory.
Eventually we hope to move these to a repo that serves this purpose.
