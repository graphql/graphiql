The GraphiQL Working Group will begin meeting to plan work for GraphiQL. The meetings will be modelled on the GraphQL Working Group meetings, but will be less formalized as this is not a spec body, just a working group for re-building a contributor community, prioritizing every few weeks and deciding on what new features we want in GraphiQL.
