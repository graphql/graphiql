/**
 * The GraphQL mode is defined as a tokenizer along with a list of rules, each
 * of which is either a function or an array.
 *
 *   * Function: Provided a token and the stream, returns an expected next step.
 *   * Array: A list of steps to take in order.
 *
 * A step is either another rule, or a terminal description of a token. If it
 * is a rule, that rule is pushed onto the stack and the parsing continues from
 * that point.
 *
 * If it is a terminal description, the token is checked against it using a
 * `match` function. If the match is successful, the token is colored and the
 * rule is stepped forward. If the match is unsuccessful, the remainder of the
 * rule is skipped and the previous rule is advanced.
 *
 * This parsing algorithm allows for incremental online parsing within various
 * levels of the syntax tree and results in a structured `state` linked-list
 * which contains the relevant information to produce valuable typeaheads.
