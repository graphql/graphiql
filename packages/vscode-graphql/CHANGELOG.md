All notable changes to the "vscode-graphql" extension will be manually documented in this file.

Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file.

The git log should show a fairly clean view of each of these new versions, and the issues/PRs associated.

# 0.3.25

Remove `node_modules` from bundle after adding `esbuild` to make the extension bundle smaller

# 0.3.24

Add highlighting and langauge support for `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.es6`, `.esm` and other similar extensions

# 0.3.23

Major bugfixes for language features. Most bugs with language features not working should be resolved.

The `useSchemaFileDefinition` setting was deprecated, and SDL-driven projects work by default. If you want to opt-into an experimental feature to cache graphql-config schema result for definitions (useful for remote schemas), consult the readme on how to configure `cacheSchemaFileForLookup` option in vscode settings, or graphql config (yes you can enable/disable it per-project!)

Definition lookup works by default with SDL file schemas. `cacheSchemaFileForLookup` must be enabled if you have a remote schema want definition lookup for input types, etc in queries

# 0.3.19

- support `graphql-config` for `.ts` and `.toml` files by upgrading `graphql-config` & `graphql-language-service-server`
- use `*` activation event, because `graphql-config` in `package.json` is impossible to detect otherwise using vscode `activationEvents`
- support additional language features in `graphql-language-service-server` such as interface implements interfaces, etc
- upgrade operation execution to use a new graphql client and support subscriptions
- fix openvsx & vscode publish by re-creating PATs and signing new agreements

Note: there are still some known bugs in the language server we will be fixing soon:

- if you don't see editor output, please check your config
- output channel may show errors even after your configuration works
- there may be issues with schema file loading

# 0.3.13

LSP bugfixes:

- [streaming interface bug](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/blob/main/packages/graphql-language-service-server/CHANGELOG.md#256-2020-11-28)
- bugfixes for windows filepaths in LSP server

# 0.3.8

- require `dotenv` in the server runtime (for loading graphql config values), and allow a `graphql-config.dotEnvPath` configuration to specify specific paths
- reload server on workspace configuration changes
- reload severside `graphql-config` and language service on config file changes. definitions cache/etc will be rebuilt
  - note: client not configured to reload on graphql config changes yet (i.e endpoints)
- accept all `graphql-config.loadConfig()` options

# 0.3.7

# 0.3.6

# 0.3.5

# 0.3.3
