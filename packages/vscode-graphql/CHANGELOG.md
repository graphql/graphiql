### Patch Changes

- [#3647](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/pull/3647) [`ba5720b`](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/commit/ba5720b430ed1c888ff64c67aa4b9a36083b9ed0) Thanks [@acao](https://github.com/acao)! - several LSP fixes and improvements:

  **Bugfixes**

  debounce schema change events to fix codegen bugs to fix #3622

  on mass file changes, network schema is overfetching because the schema cache is now invalidated on every watched schema file change

  to address this, we debounce the new `onSchemaChange` event by 400ms

  note that `schemaCacheTTL` can only be set in extension settings or graphql config at the top level - it will be ignored if configured per-project in the graphql config

  **Code Improvements**

  - Fixes flaky tests, and `schemaCacheTTL` setting not being passed to the cache
  - Adds a test to validate network schema changes are reflected in the cache

- Updated dependencies [[`ba5720b`](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/commit/ba5720b430ed1c888ff64c67aa4b9a36083b9ed0), [`fdec377`](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/commit/fdec377f28ac0d918a219b78dfa2d8f0996ff84d), [`e2c04c7`](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/commit/e2c04c7c2dc5109ff0446d9a6a010ffdffed1e44)]:
  - graphql-language-service-server@2.13.2

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

  - graphql-language-service-server@2.13.1

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [#3521](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/pull/3521) [`aa6dbbb4`](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/commit/aa6dbbb45bf51c1966537640fbe5c4f375735c8d) Thanks [@acao](https://github.com/acao)! - Fix many schema and fragment lifecycle issues, not all of them, but many related to cacheing. Note: this makes `cacheSchemaForLookup` enabled by default again for schema first contexts.

  This fixes multiple cacheing bugs, upon addomg some in-depth integration test coverage for the LSP server. It also solves several bugs regarding loading config types, and properly restarts the server and invalidates schema when there are config changes.

  ### Bugfix Summary

  - configurable polling updates for network and other code first schema configuration, set to a 30s interval by default. powered by `schemaCacheTTL` which can be configured in the IDE settings (vscode, nvim) or in the graphql config file. (1)
  - jump to definition in embedded files offset bug, for both fragments and code files with SDL strings
  - cache invalidation for fragments (fragment lookup/autcoomplete data is more accurate, but incomplete/invalid fragments still do not autocomplete or validate, and remember fragment options always filter/validate by the `on` type!)
  - schema cache invalidation for schema files - schema updates as you change the SDL files, and the generated file for code first by the `schemaCacheTTL` setting
  - schema definition lookups & autocomplete crossing over into the wrong project

  **Notes**

  1. If possible, configuring for your locally running framework or a schema registry client to handle schema updates and output to a `schema.graphql` or `introspection.json` will always provide a better experience. many graphql frameworks have this built in! Otherwise, we must use this new lazy polling approach if you provide a url schema (this includes both introspection URLs and remote file URLs, and the combination of these).

  ### Known Bugs Fixed

  - #3318
  - #2357
  - #3469
  - #2422
  - #2820
  - many more!

  ### Test Improvements

  - new, high level integration spec suite for the LSP with a matching test utility
  - more unit test coverage
  - **total increased test coverage of about 25% in the LSP server codebase.**
  - many "happy paths" covered for both schema and code first contexts
  - many bugs revealed (and their source)

  ### What's next?

  Another stage of the rewrite is already almost ready. This will fix even more bugs and improve memory usage, eliminate redundant parsing and ensure that graphql config's loaders do _all_ of the parsing and heavy lifting, thus honoring all the configs as well. It also significantly reduces the code complexity.

  There is also a plan to match Relay LSP's lookup config for either IDE (vscode, nvm, etc) settings as they provide, or by loading modules into your `graphql-config`!

### Patch Changes

- [#3521](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/pull/3521) [`aa6dbbb4`](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/commit/aa6dbbb45bf51c1966537640fbe5c4f375735c8d) Thanks [@acao](https://github.com/acao)! - Fixes several issues with Type System (SDL) completion across the ecosystem:

  - restores completion for object and input type fields when the document context is not detectable or parseable
  - correct top-level completions for either of the unknown, type system or executable definitions. this leads to mixed top level completions when the document is unparseable, but now you are not seemingly restricted to only executable top level definitions
  - `.graphqls` ad-hoc standard functionality remains, but is not required, as it is not part of the official spec, and the spec also allows mixed mode documents in theory, and this concept is required when the type is unknown

- [#3521](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/pull/3521) [`aa6dbbb4`](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/commit/aa6dbbb45bf51c1966537640fbe5c4f375735c8d) Thanks [@acao](https://github.com/acao)! - Introduce `locateCommand` based on Relay LSP `pathToLocateCommand`:

  Now with `<graphql config>.extensions.languageService.locateCommand`, you can specify either the [existing signature](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.relay#relay.pathtolocatecommand-default-null) for relay, with the same callback parameters and return signature (of a string delimited by `:` characters), or you can return an object with {uri, range} for the exact set of coordinates for the destination range. the function can be sync or async.

  Relay LSP currently supports `Type` and `Type.field` for the 2nd argument. Ours also returns `Type.field(argument)` as a point of reference. It works with object types, input types, fragments, executable definitions and their fields, and should work for directive definitions as well.

  In the case of unnamed types such as fragment spreads, they return the name of the implemented type currently, but I'm curious what users prefer here. I assumed that some people may want to not be limited to only using this for SDL type definition lookups. Also look soon to see `locateCommand` support added for symbols, outline, and coming references and implementations.

  The module at the path you specify in relay LSP for `pathToLocateCommand` should work as such.

  ```ts
  // import it
  import { locateCommand } from './graphql/tooling/lsp/locate.js';
  export default {
    languageService: {
      locateCommand,
    },

    projects: {
      a: {
        schema: 'https://localhost:8000/graphql',
        documents: './a/**/*.{ts,tsx,jsx,js,graphql}',
      },
      b: {
        schema: './schema/ascode.ts',
        documents: './b/**/*.{ts,tsx,jsx,js,graphql}',
      },
    },
  };
  ```

  ```ts
  // or define it inline

  import { type LocateCommand } from 'graphql-language-service-server';

  // relay LSP style
  const locateCommand = (projectName: string, typePath: string) => {
    const { path, startLine, endLine } = ourLookupUtility(
      projectName,
      typePath,
    );
    return `${path}:${startLine}:${endLine}`;
  };

  // an example with our alternative return signature
  const locateCommand: LocateCommand = (projectName, typePath, info) => {
    // pass more info, such as GraphQLType with the ast node. info.project is also available if you need it
    const { path, range } = ourLookupUtility(
      projectName,
      typePath,
      info.type.node,
    );
    return { uri: path, range }; // range.start.line/range.end.line
  };

  export default {
    languageService: {
      locateCommand,
    },
    schema: 'https://localhost:8000/graphql',
    documents: './**/*.{ts,tsx,jsx,js,graphql}',
  };
  ```

  Passing a string as a module path to resolve is coming in a follow-up release. Then it can be used with `.yml`, `.toml`, `.json`, `package.json#graphql`, etc

  For now this was a quick baseline for a feature asked for in multiple channels!

  Let us know how this works, and about any other interoperability improvements between our graphql LSP and other language servers (relay, intellij, etc) used by you and colleauges in your engineering organisations. We are trying our best to keep up with the awesome innovations they have ðŸ‘€!

  Users found this generally annoying by default, especially when there are required arguments

  Without automatically prompting autocompletion of required arguments as well as lead expansion, it makes the extension harder to use

  You can now supply this in your graphql config:

  `config.extensions.languageService.fillLeafsOnComplete`

  Setting it to to `true` will enable this feature. Will soon add the ability to manually enable this in `monaco-graphql` as well.

  For both, this kind of behavior would be better as a keyboard command, context menu item &/or codelens prompt

  Here we move vscode grammars and basic language support to a new [`GraphQL.vscode-graphql-syntax`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql-syntax) extension. `GraphQL.vscode-graphql` now depends on this new syntax extension. This constitutes no breaking change for `vscode-graphql` users, as this extension will be installed automatically as an `extensionDependency` for `vscode-graphql`. Both extensions will now have independent release lifecycles, but vscode will keep them both up to date for you :)

  Firstly, this allows users to only install the syntax highlighting extension if they don't need LSP server features.

  Secondly, this subtle but important change allows alternative LSP servers and non-LSP graphql extensions to use (and contribute!) to our shared, graphql community syntax highlighting. In some ways, it acts as a shared tooling & annotation spec, though it is intended just for vscode, it perhaps can be used as a point of reference for others implementing (embedded) graphql syntax highlighting elsewhere!

  If your language and/or library and/or framework would like vscode highlighting, come [join the party](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/vscode-graphql-syntax#contributing)!

  If you use relay, we would highly reccomend using the `relay-compiler lsp` extension for vscode [Relay Graphql](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.relay) (`meta.relay`). They will be [using the new standalone syntax extension](https://github.com/facebook/relay/pull/4032) very soon!

  Even non-relay users may want to try this extension as an alternative to our reference implementation, as relay's configuration has relative similarity with `graphql-config`'s format, and doesn't necessitate the use of relay client afaik. We are working hard to optimize and improve `graphql-language-service-server` as a typescript reference implementation, and have some exciting features coming soon, however it's hard to offer more than a brand new & highly performant graphql LSP server written in Rust based on the latest graphql spec with a (mostly) paid team and dedicated open source ecosystem community of co-maintainers! And their implementation appears to allow you to opt out of any relay-specific conventions if you need more flexibility.

All notable changes to the "vscode-graphql" extension will be manually documented in this file.

Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file.

The git log should show a fairly clean view of each of these new versions, and the issues/PRs associated.

# 0.3.25

Remove `node_modules` from bundle after adding `esbuild` to make the extension bundle smaller

# 0.3.24

Add highlighting and language support for `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.es6`, `.esm` and other similar extensions

# 0.3.23

Major bugfixes for language features. Most bugs with language features not working should be resolved.

The `useSchemaFileDefinition` setting was deprecated, and SDL-driven projects work by default. If you want to opt-into an experimental feature to cache graphql-config schema result for definitions (useful for remote schemas), consult the readme on how to configure `cacheSchemaFileForLookup` option in vscode settings, or graphql config (yes you can enable/disable it per-project!)

Definition lookup works by default with SDL file schemas. `cacheSchemaFileForLookup` must be enabled if you have a remote schema want definition lookup for input types, etc in queries

# 0.3.19

- support `graphql-config` for `.ts` and `.toml` files by upgrading `graphql-config` & `graphql-language-service-server`
- use `*` activation event, because `graphql-config` in `package.json` is impossible to detect otherwise using vscode `activationEvents`
- support additional language features in `graphql-language-service-server` such as interface implements interfaces, etc
- upgrade operation execution to use a new graphql client and support subscriptions
- fix openvsx & vscode publish by re-creating PATs and signing new agreements

Note: there are still some known bugs in the language server we will be fixing soon:

- if you don't see editor output, please check your config
- output channel may show errors even after your configuration works
- there may be issues with schema file loading

# 0.3.13

LSP bugfixes:

- [streaming interface bug](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/blob/main/packages/graphql-language-service-server/CHANGELOG.md#256-2020-11-28)
- bugfixes for windows filepaths in LSP server

# 0.3.8

- require `dotenv` in the server runtime (for loading graphql config values), and allow a `graphql-config.dotEnvPath` configuration to specify specific paths
- reload server on workspace configuration changes
- reload sever-side `graphql-config` and language service on config file changes. definitions cache/etc will be rebuilt
  - note: client not configured to reload on graphql config changes yet (i.e endpoints)
- accept all `graphql-config.loadConfig()` options

# 0.3.7

- update underlying `graphql-language-service-server` to allow .gql, .graphqls extensions

# 0.3.6

- documentation fix

# 0.3.5

- readme documentation improvements, more examples, FAQ, known issues
- bump `graphql-language-service-server` to allow implicit fragment completion (non-inline fragments). just include your fragments file or string in the graphql-config `documents`

# 0.3.4

- remove insiders announcement until tooling is properly in place, and insiders extension is up to date

# 0.3.3

- `useSchemaFileDefinition` setting

# 0.3.2

- #213: bugfix for input validation on operation execution

# 0.3.1 ðŸŽ‰
