It would be a shame if the word `graphql` accidentally triggered highlighting
Looks like it doesn't though! good

```graphql
query {
  something
}
```

```gql
# comment
query {
  something
}
```

```GraphQL
query {
    something @directive(first: "string")
}

type Example {
    something
}
```

```php
<?php
  $query = <<<GRAPHQL
    query {
      site {
        name
      }
    }
  GRAPHQL;
?>
```
