  Here we move vscode grammars and basic language support to a new [`GraphQL.vscode-graphql-syntax`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql-syntax) extension. `GraphQL.vscode-graphql` now depends on this new syntax extension. This constitutes no breaking change for `vscode-graphql` users, as this extension will be installed automatically as an `extensionDependency` for `vscode-graphql`. Both extensions will now have independent release lifecycles, but vscode will keep them both up to date for you :)

  Firstly, this allows users to only install the syntax highlighting extension if they don't need LSP server features.

  Secondly, this subtle but important change allows alternative LSP servers and non-LSP graphql extensions to use (and contribute!) to our shared, graphql community syntax highlighting. In some ways, it acts as a shared tooling & annotation spec, though it is intended just for vscode, it perhaps can be used as a point of reference for others implementing (embedded) graphql syntax highlighting elsewhere!

  If your language and/or library and/or framework would like vscode highlighting, come [join the party](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/vscode-graphql-syntax#contributing)!

  If you use relay, we would highly reccomend using the `relay-compiler lsp` extension for vscode [Relay Graphql](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.relay) (`meta.relay`). They will be [using the new standalone syntax extension](https://github.com/facebook/relay/pull/4032) very soon!

  Even non-relay users may want to try this extension as an alternative to our reference implementation, as relay's configuration has relative similarity with `graphql-config`'s format, and doesn't necessitate the use of relay client afaik. We are working hard to optimize and improve `graphql-language-service-server` as a typescript reference implementation, and have some exciting features coming soon, however it's hard to offer more than a brand new & highly performant graphql LSP server written in Rust based on the latest graphql spec with a (mostly) paid team and dedicated open source ecosystem community of co-maintainers! And their implementation appears to allow you to opt out of any relay-specific conventions if you need more flexibility.
