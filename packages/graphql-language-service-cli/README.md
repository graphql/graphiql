GraphQL Language Service provides an interface for building GraphQL language services for IDEs.

Almost 100% for [Microsoft's Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol) is in place

Supported features include:

- Diagnostics (GraphQL syntax linting/validations) (**spec-compliant**)
- Autocomplete suggestions (**spec-compliant**)
- Hyperlink to fragment definitions and named types (type, input, enum) definitions (**spec-compliant**)
- Outline view support for queries and SDL
- Symbols support across the workspace

## Installation and Usage

### Dependencies

An LSP-compatible client with a file watcher that sends watch notifications to the server.

**DROPPED**: GraphQL Language Service no longer depends on [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)

Only node 9 or greater, and npm or yarn are required dependencies.

### Installation

with `yarn`:

```
yarn global add graphql-language-service-cli
```

with `npm`:

```
npm i -g graphql-language-service-cli
```

either will install the `graphql-lsp` bin globally

### GraphQL configuration file (`.graphqlrc.yml`)

Check out [graphql-config](https://graphql-config.com/docs/introduction)

The custom graphql language configurations are:

- `customDirectives` - `['@myExampleDirective']`
- `customValidationRules` - returns rules array with parameter `ValidationContext` from `graphql/validation`

### Using the command-line interface

`graphql-lsp server --schema=localhost:3000`

The node executable contains several commands: `server` and the command-line language service methods (`validate`, `autocomplete`, `outline`).

```
