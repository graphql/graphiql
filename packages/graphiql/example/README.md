Example GraphiQL Install
========================

This example uses the version of GraphiQL found in the parent directory, rather
than depending on npm, so that it is easier to test new changes. In order to use
the compiled version of GraphiQL, first run build in the parent directory before
installing and starting the example.

1. Run `npm install && npm run build` in the parent directory
2. Navigate to this directory (example) in Terminal
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run setup`
5. `npm start`
6. Open your browser to the address listed in your console. e.g. `Started on http://localhost:49811/`
